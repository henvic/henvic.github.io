    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>During kindergarten, I would come back home from school and turn on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT">IBM XT</a> clone with a <abbr title="Cathode-Ray Tube">CRT</abbr> phosphorous monochrome (green) monitor to play with it. It used floppy disks, ran DOS, and barely had any disk space. I would sometimes just type random garbage on it. It was connected to a noisy dot matrix printer too. I also had limited access to other better computers from time to time during my childhood.</p>
<p>Someday, I turned it on after coming back from school, and it would die on me. I was saddened that this would be the end of it for me. Instead, my father bought a better machine. An AT 58-6 100MHz with 20MB of memory instead. It ran Windows 3.1. Sometime later, it was updated with Windows 3.11 and (voilá), Windows 95. I stuck using it for a long time – it was actually the latest Windows version I used regularly.</p>
<p>Year after year, it would get the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A big Genius SCSI flatbed scanner</li>
<li>A Creative Sound Blaster 8x multimedia kit (which came with plenty of exciting software)</li>
<li>A US Robotics 28800bps internal fax modem</li>
<li>A second IDE Hard-Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>The dial-up modem was one of the best additions. It would keep me awoke all night long to save money as you paid by the pulse and after midnight it was a single one.</p>
<p>Way before Chrome, Firefox, or even Mozilla came along, Netscape was my first browser. With it, I quickly discovered I too could create web pages using its Netscape Composer. I created <a href="http://membro.intermega.com.br/tecnologic/">my first webpage</a> when I was 9 years old using Netscape Composer and then FrontPage Express. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> was not able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020212164145/http://intermega.globo.com:80/tecnologic/intrhp.htm">recover much</a>.</p>
<p>As years passed by, I acquired experience with lots of different technical things on the web, but mostly empirically. If I had access to methodical means of learning stuff early on, I&rsquo;d be way better off today. It took a while for me to start a professional career due to a few misfortunes of life, though.</p>
<p>During these years, I learned most stuff empirically as I grew up and became exposed to many aspects of the web and its changes in the 90s and 2000s. Only after some time passed, I started to learn by more methodical means like reading manuals, studying books, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>I learned how to adjust TCL scripts for <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat" >IRC</abbr> bots called Eggdrop to my needs</li>
<li>I created an mIRC &ldquo;script&rdquo; that modified the visual of mIRC completely and added many useful actions through event listeners and commands</li>
<li>I learned to use PHP to create dynamic pages</li>
<li>I learned to use a SQL database to manage dynamic content</li>
<li>I learned about Linux: I&rsquo;d pay ~5 USD monthly to access a shell where I could run bots and serve webpages</li>
<li>I learned to read and write in English</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-unix-macos">Linux, Unix, macOS</h2>
<p>I became interested in using Linux really young. The first version I heard about was probably Conectiva Linux 4, and I bought Conectiva Linux 5 box with four CDs and some printed manuals. Afterward, I used Slackware for a few years and SUSE Linux for a few more. Then I moved to macOS, and I have been using it as my primary operating system ever since.</p>
<h3 id="conectiva-linux">Conectiva Linux</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed it. However, configuring the modem was near to impossible. So I&rsquo;d use Windows 98 SE with the Internet for a while and then go to Linux, offline.</p>
<p>I was using a softmodem, and when I finally had it working on Linux, the X server died, and I was never able to fix it.</p>
<h3 id="debian-stable">Debian stable</h3>
<p>New computer (after years using old Windows laptops). Time to try Linux full-time. I installed Debian stable and got so upset the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> Image Server didn&rsquo;t come in the first CD that the following day I moved to Slackware after a lengthly ISO download.</p>
<h3 id="slackware">Slackware</h3>
<p>Why it took so long to someone to tell me how to use ld to see the linked dependencies before trying to compile stuff? Anyways, everything worked like a charm, and the new interface for KDE was really great. I ended up using it for a couple of years.</p>
<h3 id="suse-linux">SuSE Linux</h3>
<p>I wanted to install packages and didn&rsquo;t want to compile everything myself, so I decided to give SuSE or Red Hat a try. After weighing the pros and cons of both, decided to go with SuSE. A few more couple of years with it. I was around 16 to 18 years old.</p>
<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>
<p>31 December 2008 at the Apple Store in Central Park is the date all changed (but not so fast). It was my first time out of Brazil. I had rarely used a Mac before. However, I ended up stuck there with many others during New Year&rsquo;s Eve. iPhone, iPod Touch, Mac with Mac OS X. Plenty of new stuff to me. Back then, we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of Apple products in Brazil. I was amazed and decided to do something new. My money was short, and I would spend the next 4 weeks on a film-making course and used Mac Pros and iMacs during its duration.</p>
<p>I had a dilemma: should I buy an iPod Touch + a regular laptop or a MacBook? I didn&rsquo;t have conditions to acquire both. I wanted to develop for iPod Touch, so naturally, I bought an iPod Touch. If you know the iOS ecosystem, you should be laughing by now: I made a huge mistake. I couldn&rsquo;t develop for it without a Mac.</p>
<p>One year later, I finally had an entry-level Macbook Pro 13-inch after convincing my father to help me get it. However, I was already too involved with the web and never really managed to do an iOS app besides following some basic tutorials.</p>
<h2 id="web-development">Web development</h2>
<p>By my 18s I was witnessing the web grow fast and strong. I was decided to be part of it.</p>
<p>I was enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Physics degree and dropped out to try to build something. I invested full-time working on a few different ideas, working around the clock. On my portfolio, you can see I worked on several projects of my own, such as Plifk, trazqueeupago.com, or to-post.it.</p>
<p>Tip: if you want to build something, try hard to find more people, and they don&rsquo;t need to be technical cofounders. I tried, but not that hard.</p>
<p>A few years later, I ended up going back to college. Graphical design. I dropped out once again. It was too focused on typography, history, and other matters while I was growing stronger technically as a developer.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I finally joined a BS degree in Computer Sciences and graduated from it 4 ½ years later. Just before my first term, I was offered a position to work as a front-end engineer at Liferay and accepted it. I worked for 5 years and 3 months there full-time while also studying full-time for the first four years. I accepted an offer to join HousingAnywhere in the Netherlands, and joined it in June, 2019.</p>
<p>I continue working as a software engineer writing code by day and night, and enjoy maintaining a few opensource projects on the side.</p>
<h2 id="photography-drones">Photography, drones</h2>
<p>I love photography and flying drones. You can check out my work in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/henriquev">Flickr</a>, feel free to use it as you wish. I also post some photos at <a href="https://instagram.com/henvic/">Instagram</a>.</p>
