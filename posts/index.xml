  Have fun staying poor!
Typical Bitcoin maximalist catchphrase (they also call other cryptocurrencies shitcoins while unaware Bitcoin is the worst shitcoin)  The cryptocurrency market is hot. For years, Bitcoin has been going up and up. People worldwide buy and HODL betting on The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin. Etherum and Dogecoin are gaining space in the mainstream too.  HODL is a backronym for &#34;hold on for dear life&#34;</description>

      <description>Go is one of the most prominent general-purpose programming languages nowadays. Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Adobe, to name a few, have been using the language extensively. It&amp;rsquo;s the language of choice behind multiple cloud computing projects such as Kubernetes, and it&amp;rsquo;s steadily expanding towards numerous areas of software development. In this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll find resources to learn about Go and its ecosystem.

      <description>At some point in time, perhaps with the advent of The Twelve-Factor App methodology, we saw new server-side applications moving from a file-based configuration to an environment variable configuration approach.
Many developers like to use environment variables for credentials because they are ephemeral. By relying on them, you might avoid leaking credentials on the web by accidentally checking them on public repositories, or in case of a directory traversal attack vulnerability.</description>

      <title>signal.NotifyContext: handling cancelation with Unix signals using context</title>

      <description>From Go 1.16 onwards, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use
1 2  ctx, stop := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), os.Interrupt) defer stop()   to control context cancelation using Unix signals, simplifying handling operating system signals in Go for certain common cases. This is my first contribution to the Go standard library, and I am very excited!
Why When writing CLI code, I often needed to handle cancellation â€“ for instance, when a user presses CTRL+C producing an interrupt signal.</description>

      <description>Most e-commerce platforms operate in a way that makes stores relying on them hostage due to vendor lock-in models. E-commerce is something that can get complex fast. Search engine optimization (SEO), inventory management, order status, and user experience are essential and can get hard quickly. Especially when in light of the danger of trying to make everything customizable. Substantial transaction fees drive away businesses operating on tight profit margins.  market is an opensource e-commerce software dedicated to the public domain to help small and medium businesses to establish their online presence with a high-quality website without gotchas.</description>

      <description>The source code for the game Counter-Strike: GO has leaked today. I&amp;rsquo;m sad to see many concerned users decided not to play the game anymore, for now, worried about Remote Code Execution (RCE). Valve told them they&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed the code, and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for users to worry.
Here&amp;rsquo;s I discuss what everyone should be doing about distributing software to the general public safely, and why I trust this statement:</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk a little about my experience running multiple operating systems with an Intel NUC I recently bought and the ESXi 7 hypervisor. My main idea was to use this homelab for:
  Network Area Storage (NAS)
  Kubernetes cluster
  FreeBSD playground
  Managing backup
  Stage and development machine for Go projects
