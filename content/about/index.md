title: "About me"
---

During kindergarten, I would come back home from school and turn on an [IBM XT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT) clone with a <abbr title="Cathode-Ray Tube">CRT</abbr> phosphorous monochrome (green) monitor to play with it. It used floppy disks, ran DOS, and barely had any disk space. I would sometimes just type random garbage on it. It was connected to a noisy dot matrix printer too. I also had limited access to other better computers from time to time during my childhood.

Someday, I turned it on after coming back from school, and it would die on me. I was saddened that this would be the end of it for me. Instead, my father bought a better machine. An AT 58-6 100MHz with 20MB of memory instead. It ran Windows 3.1. Sometime later, it was updated with Windows 3.11 and (voilá), Windows 95. I stuck using it for a long time – it was actually the latest Windows version I used regularly.

Year after year, it would get the following:

* A big Genius SCSI flatbed scanner
* A Creative Sound Blaster 8x multimedia kit (which came with plenty of exciting software)
* A US Robotics 28800bps internal fax modem
* A second IDE Hard-Drive

The dial-up modem was one of the best additions. It would keep me awoke all night long to save money as you paid by the pulse and after midnight it was a single one.

Way before Chrome, Firefox, or even Mozilla came along, Netscape was my first browser. With it, I quickly discovered I too could create web pages using its Netscape Composer. I created [my first webpage](http://membro.intermega.com.br/tecnologic/). Unfortunately, the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) was only able to recover its home page (which only had a link to the main page on a gif).

As years passed by, I acquired experience with lots of different technical things on the web, but mostly empirically. If I had access to methodical means of learning stuff early on, I'd be way better off today. It took a while for me to start a professional career due to a few misfortunes of life, though.

During these years, I learned most stuff empirically as I grew up and became exposed to many aspects of the web and its changes in the 90s and 2000s. Only after some time passed, I started to learn by more methodical means like reading manuals, studying books, etc.

* I learned how to adjust TCL scripts for <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat" >IRC</abbr> bots called Eggdrop to my needs
* I created an mIRC "script" that modified the visual of mIRC completely and added many useful actions through event listeners and commands
* I learned to use PHP to create dynamic pages
* I learned to use a SQL database to manage dynamic content
* I learned about Linux: I'd pay ~5 USD monthly to access a shell where I could run bots and serve webpages
* I learned to read and write in English

## Linux, Unix, macOS
I became interested in using Linux really young. The first version I heard about was probably Conectiva Linux 4, and I bought Conectiva Linux 5 box with four CDs and some printed manuals. Afterward, I used Slackware for a few years and SUSE Linux for a few more. Then I moved to macOS, and I have been using it as my primary operating system ever since.

### Conectiva Linux
I really enjoyed it. However, configuring the modem was near to impossible. So I'd use Windows 98 SE with the Internet for a while and then go to Linux, offline.

I was using a softmodem, and when I finally had it working on Linux, the X server died, and I was never able to fix it.

### Debian stable
New computer (after years using old Windows laptops). Time to try Linux full-time. I installed Debian stable and got so upset the [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) Image Server didn't come in the first CD that the following day I moved to Slackware after a lengthly ISO download.

### Slackware
Why it took so long to someone to tell me how to use ld to see the linked dependencies before trying to compile stuff? Anyways, everything worked like a charm, and the new interface for KDE was really great. I ended up using it for a couple of years.

### SuSE Linux
I wanted to install packages and didn't want to compile everything myself, so I decided to give SuSE or Red Hat a try. After weighing the pros and cons of both, decided to go with SuSE. A few more couple of years with it. I was around 16 to 18 years old.

### Mac
31 December 2008 at the Apple Store in Central Park is the date all changed (but not so fast). It was my first time out of Brazil. I had rarely used a Mac before. However, I ended up stuck there with many others during New Year's Eve. iPhone, iPod Touch, Mac with Mac OS X. Plenty of new stuff to me. Back then, we didn't have a lot of Apple products in Brazil. I was amazed and decided to do something new. My money was short, and I would spend the next 4 weeks on a film-making course and used Mac Pros and iMacs during its duration.

I had a dilemma: should I buy an iPod Touch + a regular laptop or a MacBook? I didn't have conditions to acquire both. I wanted to develop for iPod Touch, so naturally, I bought an iPod Touch. If you know the iOS ecosystem, you should be laughing by now: I made a huge mistake. I couldn't develop for it without a Mac.

One year later, I finally had an entry-level Macbook Pro 13-inch after convincing my father to help me get it. However, I was already too involved with the web and never really managed to do an iOS app besides following some basic tutorials.

## Web development
By my 18s I was witnessing the web grow fast and strong. I was decided to be part of it.

I was enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Physics degree and dropped out to try to build something. I invested full-time working on a few different ideas, working around the clock. On my portfolio, you can see I worked on several projects of my own, such as Plifk, trazqueeupago.com, or to-post.it.

Tip: if you want to build something, try hard to find more people, and they don't need to be technical cofounders. I tried, but not that hard.

A few years later, I ended up going back to college. Graphical design. I dropped out once again. It was too focused on typography, history, and other matters while I was growing stronger technically as a developer.

A couple of years later, I finally joined a BS degree in Computer Sciences and graduated from it 4 ½ years later. Just before my first term, I was offered a position to work as a front-end engineer at Liferay and accepted it. I worked for 5 years and 3 months there full-time while also studying full-time for the first four years. I accepted an offer to join HousingAnywhere in the Netherlands, and joined it in June, 2019.

I continue working as a software engineer writing code by day and night, and enjoy maintaining a few opensource projects on the side.

## Photography, drones
I love photography and flying drones. You can check out my work in [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/henriquev), feel free to use it as you wish. I also post some photos at [Instagram](https://instagram.com/henvic/).
