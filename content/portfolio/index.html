                    I designed, implemented <em>we</em> in <a href="https://www.golang.org/">Go</a>, and currently maintain it.
                    I also contributed to other areas of the whole project. Now, WeDeploy is being phased out, and
                    <a href="https://www.liferay.com/products/dxp-cloud">Liferay DXP Cloud</a> is taking its place.
                    The CLI tool is going to stay, but it is to be rebranded.

                    Two things I enjoyed building are the shell access over socket.io (which introduced me to reverse
                    engineering in the real world) and adapting <em>git</em> to work as a reliable transport layer for our
                    deployment system.

            <a href="http://vehikel.trazqueeupago.com/">Vehikel</a> is a used vehicle marketplace website
            inspired by Craigslist and eBay. I created it around 2013, but after the initial implementation was ready, we didn't
            invest in it. The source code is publicly available on GitHub.

            The most exciting thing is the real-time search engine developed with ElasticSearch and its faceted filters.
            Edit-in-place providing great usability and accessibility is another selling point.

                    The idea was to create a network similar to eBay but less formal, for second-hand goods and to empower people who had difficulty to access market goods (for example, living in closed economies).

                    I've worked on it as a backend engineer both with PHP and JavaScript (Node.JS), mostly implementing new features.
                </p>
                    The most exciting feature I've built there was a Facebook-like chat system on top of socket.io and Node.js (with a PHP backend for storing messages).
                    I also helped to refactor legacy application code and database queries (SQL) to solve performance bottlenecks using profiling techniques.

                <p><a href="http://www.plifk.com">Plifk</a> is the first web service I created and made available online.
                    It is a file sharing web service that uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> in the
                    backend.
                    The user experience was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_(website)">Multiply</a>
                    with progressive enhancement, a great <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>, and a RESTful
                    API supporting OAuth 1.0.</p>
                <p>The idea was ambitious, and I started just when <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> was
                    beginning to establish itself as a market leader. Unfortunately, I encountered no business support to
                    continue on this endeavor.</p>
                <p>One interesting thing about it is that it was one of the first sites to have an upload progress bar. Back
                    then there was no way to do it natively with HTML, so people usually didn't have it or made it with
                    Macromedia's Flash player. I used a Zend Framework solution that used long polling to overcome this lack
                    of client-side support and it worked like a charm.</p>
                <p>Also, I postponed paying for a pricey HTTPS support because it was expensive back then, and unfortunately it's still
                    running over HTTP. At least I'm glad I stored passwords appropriately hashed instead of storing in plain text or hashed with MD5 as most
                    people did back then.</p>
