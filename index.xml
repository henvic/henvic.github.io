      <description>During kindergarten, I would come back home from school and turn on an IBM XT clone with a CRT phosphorous monochrome (green) monitor to play with it. It used floppy disks, ran DOS, and barely had any disk space. I would sometimes just type random garbage on it. It was connected to a noisy dot matrix printer too. I also had limited access to other better computers from time to time during my childhood.</description>

      <description>httpretty  httpretty is a Go package to print the HTTP requests of your Go programs on the terminal screen.
It is mostly inspired in curl&#39;s verbose mode, and also on the httputil.DumpRequest and similar functions.  It implements a net/http RoundTripper for the HTTP client and an HTTP Handler for the server that intercepts the requests and extracts information out of it in a safe way, without modifying the original values wrapping your HTTP client transport layer or HTTP request multiplexer.</description>
